## About

This project is a set of libraries designed to work with [ldc][1] to 
enable native execution of D on GPUs (and other more exotic targets of OpenCL such as FPGAs DSPs, hereafter just 'GPUs') on the OpenCL and CUDA runtimes.

There are four main parts: 
* [std](https://github.com/libmir/dcompute/tree/master/source/dcompute/std): A library containing standard functionality for targetting GPUs and abstractions over the intrinsics of OpenCL and CUDA.
* [driver](https://github.com/libmir/dcompute/tree/master/source/dcompute/driver): For handling all the compute API interactions and provide a friendly, easy-to-use, consistent interface. Of course you can always get down to a lower level of interaction if you need to.
* [kernels](https://github.com/libmir/dcompute/tree/master/source/dcompute/kernels): A set of standard kernels and primitives to cover a large number of use cases and serve as documentation on how (and how not) to use this library.
* [tests](https://github.com/libmir/dcompute/tree/master/source/dcompute/tests): A framework for testing kernels. The suite is runnable with `dub test` (see `dub.json` for the configuration used).

## Examples

Kernel:
```
@kernel void saxpy(GlobalPointer!(float) res,
                   float alpha,
                   GlobalPointer!(float) x,
                   GlobalPointer!(float) y, 
                   size_t N)
{
    auto i = GlobalIndex.x;
    if (i >= N) return;
    res[i] = alpha*x[i] + y[i];
}
```

Invoke with (CUDA):
```
q.enqueue!(saxpy)
    ([N,1,1],[1,1,1]) // Block & grid & optional shared memory
    (b_res,alpha,b_x,b_y, N); // kernel arguments
```
equivalent to the CUDA code
```
saxpy<<<N,1,0,q>>>(b_res,alpha,b_x,b_y, N);
```

For more examples and the full code see `source/dcompute/tests`.
## Build Instructions

To build DCompute you will need:
* [ldc][1] as the D dcompiler.
* a SPIRV capable LLVM (available [here](https://github.com/thewilsonator/llvm/tree/compute) to build ldc to to support SPIRV (required for OpenCL)).
* or LDC built with any LLVM 3.9.1 or greater that has the NVPTX backend enabled, to support CUDA.
* [dub](https://github.com/dlang/dub)
and then just run `$dub build` or add `"dcompute": "~>0.0.1"` to your `dub.json` or `dependency "dcompute" version="~>0.0.1"` to your `dub.sdl`.

If you get an error like `Error: unrecognized switch '-mdcompute-targets=cuda-210`, make sure you are using LDC and not DMD: passing `--compiler=/path/to/ldc2` to dub will force it to use `/path/to/ldc2` as the D compiler.

A dmd compatible d compiler,[dmd](https://github.com/dlang/dmd), ldmd or gdmd (available as part of [ldc][1] and [gdc](https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC) respectively), and cmake for building ldc is also required if you need to build ldc yourself.
